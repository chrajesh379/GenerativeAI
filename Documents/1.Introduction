Generative AI is a Artificial Intilligence system that produces high quality content specifically text, audio and vedios.
Ex: Chat GPT, Bard ( Google) and Bing Chat(Microsoft)

AI already exists in our lifes.
Ex: Fruad detection when using cards. recommondations in Amazon, netflix etc. 

Gen AI generates text along with beautiful images and videos

AI is set of tools that has Supervised Learning, Un Supervised Learning, Reenforcement Learning, Generative AI

Gen AI is basically using Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning (Labeling)

Ex: 
Input (A)                                                           Output(B)                Application
Email     -> Decide whether the email is spam or not                Spam(0/1)                Spam Filtering
Ads       -> Whether customers like add or not                      Click(0/1)               Online Adventisement
Image and radder info -> identiy the position of the cars           positions of the cars    Self driving cars          
X-Ray     ->                                                        Diagnosis                Healthcare
Restarunet -> identify the business is good or not                  Sentiment                Reputation
Audio recording                                                     Text Transacript         Speech Recognition

LLM (Large Language Models) are build based on Supervised Learning (A->B with the given input produce output) to repetidly identify the next word.

When we train very large AI systme with lot of data, we get Large Language model like Chat GPT
Imagine you start a sentence, like "I love eating," and the AI can finish it with different ideas, such as "bagels with cream cheese" or "my mother's meatloaf." 
This ability comes from a special kind of technology called large language models (LLMs), which learn from a huge amount of text data to understand how words fit together.

Ex of tasks that LLM can carry out:
Reading the comments from the reviews and identify whether they are complaints or not

We have Web based LLMs ( search some topics in internet) and Software based LLMs (Specific to company -> Reading the comments from the reviews and identify whether they are complaints or not)

LLM are below types
Web Based internet applications ex: like chatGPT,bard and Bing .
Software based applications ex: email routing , document search etc.

For example, if you run an online store and receive many customer emails, Generative AI can quickly read through them and tell you if any of them are complaints. 
This way, you can handle issues faster and keep your customers happy. Just like how a good friend helps you sort through your thoughts, Generative AI helps businesses manage information efficiently.

Writing:
Ex: Giving the suggestions and writing press release. Ex: If new CEO joined and need to give press release about the CEO, we can give the basic infomation about the CEO, and details
 to provide the output for the press release

Reading:
Summarizing the articles or reading the entire PDFS and provide high level information.

Chatting:
Specilized Chatbots

Limitions
Knowledge Cutoff. LLM doesn't have information about latest news.
Gen AI not work well with structured data, but works best with Unstructured data

Supervised Learning: 
get Labeled Data (1 month) -> Train the AI model(3month) -> deploy the model to prod (3month)
Prompt based AI 
Specify the Prompt (in hours) -> Deploy the model ( in hours/Days)

Life Cycle of the Gen AI:

Scope of the Project -> Build/Improve the System -> internal Team evalution -> Deploy and monitor
Building Gen AI is expermintal process. We repetadly find and fix the mistakes

Tools to Improve the performces:
Prompting -> Try an idea and see the responce and get the LLM response
RAG ( Retrival Augemented Generation) : Give LLM access to external data sources
Fine Tune models
Pretrain Models
